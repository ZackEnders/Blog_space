# Blog_space
This is a Blog app with clean and simplistic styling. The app has full CRUD functionality on Users, Blogs, and Comments. Sign up and you're ready to start posting some blogs! 

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
1. You will need a modern web browser that can render HTML documents (e.g. Google Chrome).
2. Ruby and Rails should be installed on your computer.

### Installing
This is a stand-alone web application that does not need to be installed. It will run locally on your computer as long as you have rails installed.

Open the terminal and run ```git clone https://github.com/ZackEnders/Blog_space.git```

Next you will need to cd into the directory. Type 
```cd blog_space``` in the terminal.

After that you will need to run ```bundle install``` and ``` rails db:migrate``` in your terminal.

From the terminal fire up the rails server
```rails s```

In your browser copy and paste this link
```localhost:3000```


If done correctly the blog_space site should load.

## Known Issues
